Readme for parser.py

Requirements: 
1) install the pandas module
    - pip install pandas in the command line is the easiest way to do this
    - if this fails, run "module_manager.py" and it should give you instructions
    that help (unless your namespace includes special character like ",")
2) Setup the "data" folder
    - In the directory with "parser.py" there should be another directory, 
    named "data"
    - Subfolders of "data" should include "data/parser_input" and 
    "data/parser_output"
        - To be clear, "/" is the classic indicator of a subfolder in linux, 
        so "data/parser_output" means that there is a directory called 
        "parser_output" in the directory "data"
3) Input data
    - Place the json zendesk export with the comments you want parsed into 
    "data/parser_input"
    - Place the csv zendesk export with everything but the comments into 
    "data/parser_input"

Instructions to extract id and comments: 
- Open "parser.py"
- Run the file
- (Optional) If you want to split the file as well: 
    - In the terminal, run the file "split_data" with the inputs "data" and 
    the number of files you want the json split into.
